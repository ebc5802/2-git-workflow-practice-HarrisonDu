## Social media consumer sentiment for alpha

An example of social media data is sentiment of the markets or of specific companies to **generate alpha**. What makes this _really_ cool is that this adds a new dimensionality of value that users producte, not just for advertising but also within finance.

## Venture capital

This has also helped in **venture capital** to scout trends and invest in startups early, an example which was VEED.io.

## Conclusion

With **natural language processing** and the internet being the largest market connecting all peoples, anyone who can provide an afforable and accessible way to access this alternative data will be very successful.

With my background in webscraping this is a very promising area of interest for me to develop a unique skill in.

Interesting article! I was curious about the same topic as data scraping seems like a perfect business use case for our CS and DS skills. I'm particularly curious about the real estate investing application of data scraping.

During my Real Estate Development and Entrepreneurship class with [Professor Atkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-atkins-b1718530/), I learned about the different databases such as [PropertyShark](https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/). An aggregate web-scraping algorithm which scours different databases and websites would be an invaluable tool to small to medium developers.
